-- After some thinking I realized this isn't anything worth of value and can be used to improve your whitelist system for your paid scripts if you want them to be time-based like SCV3. I made this a few months ago, since SCV3 officially released.

local timelimit = "12/30/2022"

local ctime = os.date("%m/%d/%Y")

if ctime > timelimit then
    pcall(function()
        while true do end
        game.Players.LocalPlayer:Kick("OS Time too far ahead. Please check machine date configuration")
    end)
end

-- I made it so while true do end runs before the kick since I don't want to leak my custom kick system yet, bypasses hooked returns and other hookmethods
